This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Firebase deploy

You need to create a new project in [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### Step 1: Install the Firebase CLI and build react app

Run `npm run build`.
Visit the Firebase CLI documentation to learn how to install the CLI or update to its latest version.
If you want to skip docs install firebase-cli with `npm install -g firebase-tools`

### Step 2: Login and initialize your project

Sign in to your google account
`firebase login`

To connect your local project to your Firebase project, run the following command from the root of your local project directory:
`firebase init` and follow cli steps.

### Step 3: Deploy to your site

To deploy to your site, run the following command from the root of your local project directory:
`firebase deploy`

This command deploys a release to your Firebase project's default Hosting sites:

- projectID.web.app
- projectID.firebaseapp.com

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
